# Seal Counter CLI - User Guide

Welcome to the **Seal Counter CLI**! This guide will walk you through installing Python, setting up a virtual environment, and running the program.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:
- A computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- An internet connection

---

## Step 1: Install Python (Version 3.8 - 3.12)

If you don't have Python installed:

1. Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download a version within **3.8 to 3.12** for your operating system (This program was built using **Python 3.10.4** so we recommend using that)
3. Run the installer and **check the box** that says `Add Python to PATH` before clicking `Install Now`.
4. Verify the installation:
   - Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal)
   - Type:
     ```sh
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see something like `Python 3.x.x` (where `x.x` is your version).

## Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder (where `seals_counter_cli.py` is located):
   ```sh
   cd path/to/this/repository
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Step 3: Run the Seal Counter CLI

Once the virtual environment is set up, run the program using:
```sh
python seals_counter_cli.py
```
If you're returning to this program, and you've already set up the virtual environment on your computer (Step 2.), you need to run:
```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
to reactive the virtual environment before running the program again.

## Step 4: Follow the Prompt

When the program runs, it will ask you to **provide a folder path** within the repository. Simply type the path and press `Enter` when prompted. 
There is currently an existing folder in this repository named "beach_images" with 2 beaches already uploaded as examples. 
To have this model run on new images, upload new beach images into that folder, type in "beach_images" when prompted for a folder, and be patient!

You can also upload a new folder of images that you can specify for this program to run with. 

Please make sure that new images are formatted in one of the following file extensions: `.jpeg` `.png` `.jpg` `.tif` `.tiff`

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Command not found?** Ensure Python is installed and added to PATH.
- **Virtual environment not activating?** Make sure youâ€™re using the correct activation command for your system.
- **Missing dependencies?** Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

If you need further help, feel free to open an issue on this repository!
